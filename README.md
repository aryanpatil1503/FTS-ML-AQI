Anjali Singh - I have done preprocessing of the data.on both of the dataset cities_by_day and cities_by_hour .I looked for the null values using using visualiztion with the help of heatmap  present in both the dataset and handled those NAN values using mean function in cities_by_day and with median in cities_by_hours i.e. NAN values are replaced with the mean and median of that respective columns.Then i did some visualization part for both dataset.Also found the correlations and finally after that I visualized outliers using boxplot and in whatever columns i found large number of outliers ,in both of the dataset ,i handled then using Z score method , and finally i found my cleaned data.
